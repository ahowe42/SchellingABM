<h3>Schelling's Model of Segregation</h3>
<p> In the 1970's, economist Thomas Schelling started investigating the prevalence of residential segregation along racial and socio-economic lines. It was thought that segregation was so prevalent because certain classes of people have strong preferences to live among others like them. Schelling developed a simple game theory model with agents representing people living in neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Each agent has a similarity preference (SP) which dictates how many neighbors need to be similar for the agent to be happy. In the grid where each locus represents a home where an agent can live, the &quot;neighborhood&quot; of the agent includes the grid locations within distance 1. An SP of 8 indicates that an agent would only be happy if completely surrounded by similar agents. At the other extreme, SP=0 would indicate that an agent didn't care about the neighborhoods similarity.</p>
<p>When Schelling developed the model concept, computers were not as widespread as now, so he drew out a grid on paper, used coins for agents, and manually kept track of the results. His results suggested that large-scale segregation occur even when people only have weak preferences for similar neighbors.</p>

<h3>Complex Adaptive Systems &amp; Emergence</h3>
<p>The power of the agent-based models such as this is in the complexity and patterns that arises from simplicity. In this case, each agent evaluates a simple relation for happiness: <it>happy=&#91;n(neighbors similar)&ge;SP&#93;</it>. If an agent is unhappy, it follows the simple rule of making a move to a randomly-selected unoccupied location on the grid. The process of evaluating happiness then possibly moving is iterated over all agents in sequence until some criteria is met. Even with low SPs, marked patterns of segregation arise as the model is iterated. The pattern of segregation can be called <it>emergent behavior</i>.</p>

<h3>My Implementation</h3>
<p>I have developed this model here in Python as a very simple project by which to get familiar with GITHUB (besides the fact that it's cool!). Agents are coded as objects, which is probably the most logical and flexible way to do that. What I've done that might be less typical is encoded each agent with a Race attribute, which is also a separate object. While each Person (the agent) object can have their own SP, the SP is currently an attribute of the Race object. This structure can easily be extended to allow each agent to have multiple characteristics along which similarity preference can be measured (age, education, etc&hellip;).</p>

<h3>Sample Model Output</h3>
<p>As a simple demonstration, we show here visual results from running the model for a pre-specified maximum of 500 iterations, using a <it>50&times;50</it> grid with 2,375 agents (5&#37; unoccupied space). There are 3 races with SPs of 30&#37;, 60&#37;, and 20&#37;. Their are 625, 1000, and 750 agents of each respective type, so the weighted average SP is 0.39. Using these numbers, the grid was randomly populated, and shown on the left pane of Figure 1. Agents are marked with a &deg; if they are happy, and &times; otherwise. Unfilled circles are empty locations. With the random initialization, approximately 42&#37; of the agents were happy. The right pane of Figure 1 shows the rsulting pattern of segregation after 500 iterations, with about 85&#37; of the agents happy. Note the marked patterns of segregation that have emerged as a result of the iterative application of the simple rules.</p>
<p>Figure 2 tells us some by-iteration information about the models evolution. In the left pane, we see that the number of happy agents converged very quickly to near 85&#37; in fact, it had converged by iteration 20, and just made small corrections for the remaining 480 iterations. The right pane shows how many agents moved to new locations in each iteration. This metric similarly converged quickly to around 470 movers in each iteration.</p>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
